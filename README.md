I referenced lbuell/Wordinator-API.

I couldn't wrap my head around how to take information in from a URL, but through routes now makes sense.  I made the controller method far more verbose than I had to...but just like seeing it as expressive as possible.

Curious about the delimiter....I feel like I followed suit and used the & character, but changed it to accept json format:  therefore one must enter in the url '/anagram/{"word1":"word2"}' to get a proper json render.
